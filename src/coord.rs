//! math in 3 dimensions with scalars and other coordinates. Used to unify math with colors that is
//! the same, just with different projections into 3D space.

/// A point in 3D space. Supports many common arithmetic operations on points.
/// `Coord` has three axes, denoted `x`, `y`, and `z`. These are not any different in any method of
/// `Coord`, so the distinction between them is completely conventional. In Scarlet, any `Color`
/// that converts to and from a `Coord` will match its components with these axes in the order of the
/// letters in its name: for example, `CIELABColor` maps to a coordinate such that `l` is on the
/// x-axis, `a` is on the y-axis, and `b` is on the z-axis.
///
/// # Examples
/// ## Basic Operations
/// ```
/// # use scarlet::coord::Coord;
/// let point_1 = Coord{x: 1., y: 8., z: 7.};
/// let point_2 = Coord{x: 7., y: 2., z: 3.};
/// // Add two points together to do componentwise addition.
/// let sum = point_1 + point_2;  // the point (8, 10, 10)
/// // Subtract two points the same way.
/// let diff = point_1 - point_2;  // the point (-6, 6, 4)
/// // There is no multiplication of two points, because there are many different ways to conceptualize
/// // multiplying two points and Scarlet doesn't need it. Instead, it supports scalar multiplication
/// // and division. This has the unfortunate side effect of not allowing multiplication one way.
/// let prod = point_1 * 2u8; // the point (2, 16, 14)
/// // switching the above operands' order would cause an error!
/// let quot = point_1 / 2.; // the point (0.5, 4, 3.5)
/// ```
